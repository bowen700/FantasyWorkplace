Fantasy Workplace (AKA Duelz)



what if...
employees could see performance tracking as a more positive helpful activity

so that...
that they could grow more and have fun with key performance indicators

for example...
employees could find friendly competition one another

and that's not all...
the friendly competition could become very engaging and bring lots of focus on the behaviors that matter in the workplace.



This app has different functions. The main intention is to allow employees the option to opt in to a gamified competition using their key performance indicators.
You heard that right. Employees could opt in to making their key performance metrics public (not to the general public... just to their team)
Why would they ever do that? Sports fans have an idea why they might. Statista research states that about 29 million people participated in fantasy football in 2023.

29 million people competed with one another in fantasy football. How does fantasy football get it's scores? Through public performance metrics. 
Thousands and thousands of professional athletes have performance metrics public where everyone can see. 
These metrics are used for SO many things. My favorite reason, as you can guess by now, is fantasy sports.
I love the thrill of competing against my friends by trying to put together the best score each week.
One of the main problems with fantasy football (& other fantasy sports) is its conflict between your actions and someone else's actions.
The user only has control of what players they have on their team and who they choose to add to their lineup. If their team loses, then the user might start blaming the players or even their coaches.
Here's the point Im getting to... In fantasy workplace, -YOU- have the control over your own destiny. Your efforts are what lead you to success.

I think almost every organization wishes their employees would focus more on behaviors and actions that lead to success in the workplace instead of other various behaviors.
Fantasy workplace can do just that. It can bring the focus away from things that are distracting, and bring attention to things that can really boost a workplace.

Fantasy workplace can be adaptable to different industries. 
Lets say you work in healthcare and you aren't sure if performance metrics should be the focus. You could have OCB (organizational citizenship behaviors) be what is measured and tracked instead.
Imagine yourself trying to get to work 10 minutes early every day, because you know it will give you just enough points to boost past you coworkers score.
Maybe you are the other coworker that shows up late more often... but you did tons of the other 2 OCB's that were being measured. You could still win!
There are other functions of Duelz (Fantasy Workplace) that can bring focus and fun to the workplace.

One of my biggest recommendations is to make fantasy workplace seasonal. Competing too much for too long can begin to wear and tear. That is why this app is set to be seasonal. 
There can be a regular season winner, and a playoff winner. then, once the season is over, you have 9 months to focus on other important organizational changes while recovering.


Thanks for reading my README. I really appreciate it. I hope Fantasy Workplace is something that can boost you or your workplace. Have a great day!
