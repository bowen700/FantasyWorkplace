🎮 Fantasy Workplace — Gamified Performance Management App

Built with: Flask + TailwindCSS + Chart.js + Replit DB (prototype)
By: Bowen Oswald

🧠 Overview

Fantasy Workplace turns employee performance management into a friendly, gamified competition. Each week, participants go head-to-head in matchups based on key performance indicators (KPIs) selected by the admin.
At the end of the regular season (about 10 weeks), the top performers advance to a 4-week playoff tournament—just like fantasy sports.

The app makes performance feedback fun, motivating, and transparent while maintaining fairness and data integrity.

🚀 Setup Instructions

Create a new Flask project in Replit.

Add the following dependencies in requirements.txt:
flask, flask-login, bcrypt, pandas, chart.js, openai, tailwindcss

Initialize your Flask app structure with folders: /static, /templates, and core files such as app.py, db.py, and models.py.

Create environment variables in Replit:
OPENAI_API_KEY = “your-key-here”
ADMIN_EMAIL = “admin@example.com
”

Run the app and log in as admin to configure KPIs and start the first season.
